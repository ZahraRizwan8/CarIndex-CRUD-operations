Hopefully you are doing well.
Here is Assignment#2 which will cover the bootstrap, JavaScript topics which we have studied so far.

At this time we are going to solve the issue Which I am facing and Definitely it is the problem which you guys are facing too. Managing numerous business cards and shop cards can be a hassle. To address this issue, we're tasked with designing a website that allows users to add, search, update, and delete card information.

Features:
Add Card Information:
Users can add card information including date, time, title, description, event, nearest place, and optionally upload an image.

Search and Filter:
Users can search for specific information using various filters like date, time, title, event, or any other keyword.
There must be a general filter in which user can type any info and it will extract records which contains that text. 

Delete Specific Record:
Users can delete a specific card record if no longer needed.

Delete All:
Option to delete all card records at once.

Update Record:
Users can update card information such as date, time, description, etc.

You can also add other function's i.e sorting etc. which you think is important. 

 Additionally, users can choose from various themes to customize the website's appearance according to their mood.
Theme Options:
Users can choose from different themes like cool, sad, funny, etc. (that theme will be applied on your website each time until you change it again).
Each theme includes customizable options such as font name, font style, font color, body color, background color, margin style, etc.
Furthermore, Also give the option of adding new theme.
Technologies Used:
Bootstrap for responsive design.
JavaScript for dynamic functionality. (As in React and Node JavaScript language is used so its a good time to make something interesting using JavaScript).
HTML and CSS for structure and styling.
